PAYE tax and Class 1 National Insurance contributions
You normally operate PAYE as part of your payroll so HMRC can collect Income Tax and National Insurance from your employees.

Your payroll software will work out how much tax and National Insurance to deduct from your employees’ pay. If you decide to run payroll yourself, you need to find payroll software to do this.

Tax thresholds, rates and codes
The amount of Income Tax you deduct from your employees depends on their tax code and how much of their taxable income is above their Personal Allowance.
